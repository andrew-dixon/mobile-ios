Test Cases for Data Model

SUPPORTS MULTIPLE USERS:
TEST 1:
- Log in as user A.
- Add a meal event with time of known user A glucose/insulin log events
- View meal event:
    -> Verify should see user A's data.
- Log out. Log in as user B.
    -> Verify logout did not take more than a second.
    -> Verify user A meal event is not present.
- Create user B meal event with time of known user B data.
- View meal event:
    -> Verify should see user B's data.
- Create user B meal event with time of known user A (!) data.
- View meal event:
    -> Verify should NOT see user A's data.
TECH NOTES: User meal events are stored in the same database but tagged with current user id from service; the application should only display those meal events for the current user. Other user tidepool data is loaded into a database that is reset when the application switches users; only data for the current user should be seen.

SUPPORTS FAST LOGOUT-LOGIN:
TEST 1:
- Log in as user A.
- Add several meal events with time of many known user A glucose/insulin log events (create one, then "eat again", changing dates on all the new meal events)
- View meal events, zooming out to force load lots of data
- Log out.
    -> Verify logout did not take more than a second.
- Log back in quickly, same user.
    -> Verify meal events are still present
    -> Verify meal event detail view loads same data
TECH NOTES: On logout all cached tidepool glucose/insulin data is purged. On login, it should be brought back in as the user looks at data.
